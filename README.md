Three observable trends based on the data to break down the game's purchasing data:

Gender:

The gender demographics shows a significant difference in the number of male and female players, 84.03% and 14.06%, respectively. While male players make more purchases, the female ones spend more than them on average. The remaning percentage of players that identifies as other or did not disclose makes up only 1.91% of the total players, however they spend more on average than the two other gender groups.


Age:

The age demographics shows that most players are between the age of 20-24 making up 44.79% of total players, and subsequently making more purchases than any other age group. However, the players that spend the most on average are between the age of 35-39, thus contributing more towards the gaming company revenue. A close runner-up is the 0-10 age group.


Items:

From the 179 items sold at price range $1-$4.99, the most popular and profitable item is Final Critic, despite being one of the most expensive ones, priced at $4.61. The items with a lower price tag have a low purchase count, thus not having much of a contribution towards the gaming company revenue.
